Description: A statistical disclosure control tool to protect tables by suppression using the Gaussian elimination secondary suppression algorithm. Primary suppression functions for the minimum frequency rule, the dominance rule and a directly-disclosive rule are included. General primary suppression functions can be supplied as input. Suppressed frequencies can be replaced by synthetic decimal numbers as described in Langsrud (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9848-9>.
